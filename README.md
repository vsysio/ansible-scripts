# ansible-scripts

### To validate my devops experience, I am releasing a handful of my private Ansible scripts here.
### Note that ansible plugins like to change things around all the time. I do keep my personal repo updated from time to time, but these were written for 2.6.0, and developed for Ubuntu 16.04.

### Once AWS releases Ubuntu 18.04 LTS as a standard production AMI, I may rewrite these if necessary.
